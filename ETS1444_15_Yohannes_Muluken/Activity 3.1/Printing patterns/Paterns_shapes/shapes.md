displaying different patterns

1. Problem - display different shapes

2. problem analysis

   1. input - shapes choice, no of row, inputs needed for the shape
   2. output - shape / pattern
   3. operation: create
      - Full rectangle
      - holow rectangle
      - half pyramid
      - inverted half pyramid
      - hollow inverted half pyramid
      - full pyramid
      - hollow full pyramid

3. Algorithm design

   1. start
   2. read choice of the user and no of rows
   3. full rectangle (choice 1)
      1. read no of columns
      2. set outer and inner loop using no of rows and columns
      3. print the shape
   4. holow rectangle (choice 2)
      1. read no of columns
      2. set outer and inner loop using no of rows and columns
      3. print the charactor on the outer sides of the shape
   5. half pyramid (choice 3)
      1. set outer and inner loop using no of rows and columns
      2. print the charactor everytime column number is less or equal to row
   6. inverted half pyramid (choice 4)
      1. set outer and inner loop using no of rows and columns
      2. print the charactor, increse the inner loop's iteration while decreasing the outer loop's
   7. hallow inverted half pyramid (choice 5)
      1. set outer and inner loop using no of rows and columns
      2. print the charactor on the outer sides of the pyramid
      3. increase inner loop's iteration while decreasing outer loop's
   8. full pyramid (choice 6)
      1. set outer and inner loop using no of rows and columns
      2. print the charactor filling the pyramid
   9. holow full pyramimd
      1. set outer and inner loop using no of rows and columns
      2. print the charactor on the outer sides of the pyramid
