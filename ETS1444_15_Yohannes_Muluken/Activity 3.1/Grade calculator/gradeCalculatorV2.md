grade calculator

1. Problem - convert mark to letter grade

2. Problem analysis

   1. input - test, quiz, project, assignment, final
   2. output - letter grade
   3. operation:
      - find the total mark by
        - mark = test + quiz + project + assignment + final
      - convert mark to letter grade

3. Algorithm desigm

   1. start
   2. read test, quiz, project, assignment, final
   3. calculate mark as:
      - mark = test + quiz + project + assignment + final
   4. convert total mark to letter grade according to:
      - mark >= 90, grade = A+
      - mark >= 80, grade = A
      - mark >= 75, grade = B+
      - mark >= 60, grade = B
      - mark >= 55, grade = C+
      - mark >= 45, grade = C
      - mark >= 30, grade = D
      - mark < 30, grade = F
   5. display letter grade
   6. end
