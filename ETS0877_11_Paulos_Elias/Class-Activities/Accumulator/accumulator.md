# Accumulator
- Reads a series of numbers and adds up those not divisible by 3 and 7

## Input
- Length of list
- List of numbers
## Output
- Sum of those numbers not divisible by 3 and 7
## Process
- Divisiblity can be determined by modulus operation
- The numbers are added up
## Algorithm
1. Start
2. Read the length of list as n
3. Sum = 0
4. Read a nuber as num
5. If num is not divisible by 3 or 7, add it to sum
6. Reapeat from 4 n times
7. Print sum
8. End
